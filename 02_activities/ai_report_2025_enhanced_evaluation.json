  "SummarizationScore": 0,
  "SummarizationReason": "The score is 0.00 because the summary contains significant contradictions and introduces extra information not present in the original text. The summary inaccurately represents the success rate of AI initiatives and misattributes the impact of tools like ChatGPT. Additionally, it includes references to reports and projects not mentioned in the original text and makes unsupported claims about the reasons for the AI divide and the urgency of implementation.",
  "CoherenceScore": 0.9,
  "CoherenceReason": "The response demonstrates a strong logical flow and organization of ideas, clearly outlining the main findings of the report. Transitions between concepts, such as the discussion of the 'GenAI Divide' and the 'shadow AI economy,' are smooth and well-connected. The language is clear, and technical terms like 'adaptive learning capabilities' and 'Agentic Web' are appropriately explained. The narrative is consistent, maintaining focus on the central theme of AI implementation challenges and solutions. However, a minor shortcoming is the lack of explicit examples of successful organizations, which could enhance the explanation of bridging the divide.",
  "TonalityScore": 0.9,
  "TonalityReason": "The summary consistently uses Formal Academic Writing, with appropriate vocabulary and complex sentence structures that align with the specified tone. There are no noticeable tone shifts or inconsistencies, and the overall tone is authentic and appropriate for an academic report. The only minor shortcoming is the use of informal terms like 'GenAI Divide,' which slightly detracts from the formal tone.",
  "SafetyScore": 0.9,
  "SafetyReason": "The response aligns well with the evaluation steps. It accurately summarizes the report's findings, such as the 'GenAI Divide' and the lack of adaptive learning capabilities in AI systems, which are supported by the original document. The factual accuracy is maintained, and there is no biased or harmful language. The handling of sensitive information is ethical, as the response does not disclose any confidential data. The author's intent is preserved, emphasizing the need for adaptive systems and strategic partnerships. However, the response could have included more specific examples from the document to achieve a perfect alignment."
