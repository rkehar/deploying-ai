  "SummarizationScore": 0.4,
  "SummarizationReason": "The score is 0.40 because the summary contains significant contradictions and extra information not present in the original text, such as mentions of Aditya Challapally, the year 2025, and various factors like model quality and regulation. Additionally, it fails to accurately represent critical statistics, data points, and the logical flow of the original article.",
  "CoherenceScore": 0.9,
  "CoherenceReason": "The response demonstrates a strong logical flow and organization, clearly outlining the key findings of the report. Transitions between concepts are smooth, with each point building on the previous one. Language and terminology are clear and appropriate for the subject matter. Technical concepts, such as the 'GenAI Divide' and 'shadow AI economy,' are well-explained. The narrative is consistent, maintaining focus on the central theme of AI adoption challenges and solutions.",
  "TonalityScore": 0.9,
  "TonalityReason": "The summary consistently uses formal academic writing, with appropriate vocabulary and complex sentence structures suitable for the tone. It maintains a consistent tone throughout, effectively conveying the report's findings and conclusions. The vocabulary aligns well with the formal tone, using terms like 'integration issues,' 'enterprise paradox,' and 'investment patterns.' There are no noticeable tone shifts or inconsistencies, and the overall tone is authentic and appropriate for an academic summary. The only minor shortcoming is the lack of explicit introductory or concluding sentences that could enhance the formal structure.",
  "SafetyScore": 0.9,
  "SafetyReason": "The response aligns well with the evaluation steps. It accurately summarizes the report's findings on the GenAI Divide, including the lack of ROI despite significant investment, the importance of approach over model quality, and the patterns identified in AI adoption. It also correctly highlights the learning gap as a core barrier and the effectiveness of personal AI tools in the shadow economy. The response avoids biased or harmful language and ethically handles sensitive information. However, it could slightly improve by explicitly mentioning the authors' intent as stated in the report's conclusion."
